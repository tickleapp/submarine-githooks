# Submarine Githooks
Git-hooks used by [Tickle](https://tickleapp.com)


## Install

Install the tool by ```pip3 install submarine-githooks```
(or if you only have Python 2.7, use ```pip install submarine-githooks```)


## Setup

Go to your repo folder, then ```submarine-githooks install```.
The `install` command will create `.githooks` folder for you and link it to replace your `.git/hooks`

You could also prepare a setup script for your collaborators by ```submarine-githooks setup-script```
This command creates a `setup-githooks` for your collaborators to setup git hooks.

(the `install` command links the .git/hooks and creates rooms for your git hooks.
 The script generated by `setup-script` just does the link thing, assuming rooms for git hooks already exists.)


## Checkers

Submarine will find checkers from Python modules you put under `.githooks/checkers`.
All checkers should be an instance of `submarine_githooks.checker.Checker`, the easiest way to
create a checker is:
```python
from submarine_githooks.checker import checker


@checker
def a_simple_checker(*args):
    pass
```
and then saves it to `.githooks/checkers` as `some_checker.py`

You could reference the arguments which will be passed in at following section.

### Checker settings

#### Active hooks

```python
@checker
@checker.active_hooks('pre-commit')
def a_checker(*args):
    pass


@checker
@checker.active_hooks('pre-commit', 'post-merge')
def another_checker(*args):
    pass


@checker
@checker.active_hooks('pre-commit')
@checker.active_hooks('post-merge')
def third_checker(*args):
    pass

```

By registering active hooks, the checker will then work only for that type of git hook.
(By default, checkers works for all type of git hooks)

In the above example, the first checker works only for `pre-commit` hook, and the following 2 works for both `pre-commit` and `post-merge`.

Reference: [git hooks types](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-git-hooks-to-automate-development-and-deployment-tasks).

#### File pattern and extension

```python
@checker
@checker.file_pattern(r'\.py$')
def a_checker(*args):
    pass

@checker
@checker.file_extension('.json')
def another_checker(*args):
    pass
```

You can also register supported file types for a checker.


### Checker implementation

Once if a checker raises any Python exception, the git hook will exit with a non-zero return code.
So, for example, if you want to check all json files are correct and parsable before commit,
you could make a checker like:
```python
@checker
@checker.active_hooks('pre-commit')
@checker.file_extension('.json')
def pre_commit(git_repo, hook_name, file_path):
    json.loads(git_repo.file_content(file_path))

```

So this checker is only active to files which has `.json` extension, and is only active for `pre-commit`.
If the content is not JSON-parsable (i.e. the `json.loads` method raises a `ValueError` exception), the `pre-commit` hook exits with a non-zero return code. And then the `git commit` is aborted.

Note, you should use the `git_repo` object to fetch file content but not read directly from disk
because the content you should check is the one which has been added into git index.
